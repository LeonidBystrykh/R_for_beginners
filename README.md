# R_for_beginners
This is a place for the supplementary material for the course "A quick introduction to R", which I am preparing for the YouTube. 

My channel on youtube is @ScientificIllustrations, which is nearly impossible to find due to the youtube search algorythms. The direct link is https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificIllustrations-yx8wr

There are three playlists so far:

1. Very Quick introduction to R for absolute beginners
2. Basic figures in R
3. Gene expression data for beginners

branch edgeR_scripts contais scripts I used for the videos on youtube dedicated to edgeR protocols. There are 5 in total.

It is aimed for absolute beginners with biology type of a background
