# R_for_beginners
This is a place for the supplementary material for the course "A quick introduction to R", which I am preparing for the YouTube. 
The direct link is here: https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificIllustrations-yx8wr
I will appreciate if you pay visit to the channel, although 
it is aimed for absolute beginners with biology type of a background.

The work is in progress
